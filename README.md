# logprobs-visualizations
Exploring the LLM logprobs via tree visualizations

**Main utility**: generate a visual representation of the tree of potential next tokens and their corresponding probabilites given a starting token or sequence.

I built this to help me build a better intuition around logprobs and their potential utility.
